# EDA
simple exploratory data anlysis on iris dataset using python
 Exploratory Data Analysis on the Iris Dataset
This project performs a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Iris dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. The goal is to understand the structure, patterns, and insights in the data before applying machine learning models.

📊 Features
Data loading using Seaborn's built-in dataset.

Summary statistics and visual inspection.

Visualizations: histograms, scatter plots, pair plots.

Feature scaling using StandardScaler.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

🛠️ Installation
Make sure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
🚀 How to Run
Clone this repository or download the EDA.ipynb file.

Open the notebook with Jupyter:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook EDA.ipynb
Run each cell sequentially to explore the analysis.
